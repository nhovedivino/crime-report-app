                <p><b>Prevention Tips:</b></p>
                <p>1. <b>Trust your instincts.</b> If you sense trouble, get away as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>2. <b>Show confidence.</b> Walk at a steady pace, keep your head up and avoid carrying lots of packages…It can make you look defenseless.</p>
                <p>3. <b>Don't look like an easy target.</b> Robbers want someone who will provide the least resistance. If you look like you know where you are going, walk with your head up and eyes alert, you will most likely be left alone.</p>
                <p>4. <b>Be observant.</b></p>
                <p>5. <b>Remain alert</b>  and observe the people around you.  Know who is walking behind and in front of you. Things to watch for include suspicious persons or vehicles, people who are wearing inappropriate clothing for the weather (e.g. a long or heavy coat in warm weather), and people just loitering around.</p>
                <p>6. <b>Walk in well-lit areas.</b> If possible, do not walk alone.</p>
                <p>7. <b>Be aware of your surroundings.</b> If you think you are being followed, go to a crowded area.</p>
                <p>8. <b>Do not carry large amounts of money.</b></p>
                <p>9. <b>Carry keys in your hand.</b></p>
                <p>10. <b>Do not carry large amounts of money.</b></p><br><br>
                <p><b>If You Are Robbed:</b></p>
                <p>1. <b>Remain calm.</b></p>
                <p>2. <b>Make personal safety the number one priority.</b> Money and property can be replaced.</p>
                <p>3. <b>Carefully observe the physical characteristics of the robber.</b> Be a good witness. Note as much detail about the suspect(s) as possible.  (Age, race, height, facial hair, speech, clothing, odor, etc.)</p>
                <p>4. <b>When it is safe, notify the police by calling 911.</b></p>
                <p>5. Police dispatch will ask for the location of the robbery, whether anyone is injured, the exact time the robber(s) left and their direction of travel, the kind of weapon used, description of the vehicle, the robber(s) description, their clothing, appearance or unique features, money or items taken, and other information to assist responding officers.</p>
                <p>6. <b>Protect the scene of the crime.</b> Be careful not to touch anything to avoid destroying evidence.  </p>
                <p>7. <b>Ask any witnesses to stay until police arrive.</b> If they cannot stay, get their name, address and phone number.</p>
                <p>8. <b>Write down all suspect information immediately</b> and do not discuss the robbery with others until questioned by the police. Comparing notes could cause memories to be skewed.</p>

                <p><b>Prevention Tips:</b></p>
                <p>1. Keep valuables out of sight; including purses and wallets, cell phones, electronics and jewelry, and never leave your valuables unattended.</p>
                <p>2. Do not carry more than you need. Leave unnecessary valuable items securely in your residence. Carry only the minimum amount of money or credit cards you will need for the day.</p>
                <p>3. Wait until you arrive at your location to make cell phone calls. However, if you must talk on your cell phone while traveling, use headphones or a hands-free device to that you can keep your phone secure and out of sight.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p><b>Personal Safety:</b></p>
                <p>1. Avoid isolated areas—underground garages, alleys, parking lots, and offices after business hours.</p>
                <p>2. Walk with a group, especially at night and utilize the campus shuttle.</p>
                <p>3. Be familiar with locations of the Blue Light Emergency Phones on campus.</p>
                <p>4. If you feel like you are being followed, move as fast as possible towards the nearest lighted and populated building. You can also cross the street in the middle of the road or flag down a passing car for assistance. If on-campus, activate a Blue Light Emergency Phone or call Trinity DPS (202-884-9111).</p>
                <p>5. Keep a firm grip on your purse or backpack. Keep the bag zipped closed, and carry it under your arm and near the front of your body.</p>
                <p>6. Carry your wallet inside your coat or in your front pants pocket.</p>
                <p>7. Maintain a safe distance from strangers, even if they just ask for directions.</p>
                <p>8. Be aware of your surroundings when using ATM’s. If you see anyone or anything suspicious, cancel your transaction. If you must use an ATM after hours, use one in a well-lit area where you feel safe.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p><b>Safety on the Metro and while travelling through the city</b></p>
                <p>1. Wait for public transit in a well-lit and populated area.</p>
                <p>2. Avoid using electronic devices on the metro rail or metro bus especially when seated near the doors. Thefts happen quickly, and thieves are more likely to grab phones from the hands of people sitting near the doors.</p>
                <p>3. Do not sleep on the bus or Metro. When riding the Metro, sit in a car with other people or in the first car near the conductor.</p>
                <p>4. Always lock your bike in the proper manner, with the lock securing both the front tire, and the frame of the bike to the rail.</p>
                <p>5. Have a plan when you go out. Decide before you leave how you will get home. Let someone know where you are going, with whom, and what time you plan to return.</p>
                <p>6. Learn about the neighborhoods where you live, work, volunteer, and have fun. Know the locations of police and fire stations, hospitals, and shops that are open late.</p>

                <p><b>Safety at Home:</b></p>
                <p>1. Replace or re-key locks when you move into a new home or apartment. Install a door viewer and a 1-inch deadbolt lock and use them. Look before opening your door to anyone.</p>
                <p>2. Keep doors locked at all times and instruct children never open your door to anyone.</p>
                <p>3. Require all strangers to show identification. If you haven't called for a repairman, don't let one inside. Leave him waiting outside and call his place of business to verify his reason for being in your area.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p><b>Prevention Tips:</b></p>
                <p>1. Secure your car and home. Keep a large flashlight, a cell phone, a map of the city you are in, and a cash with you when in a car. The flashlight can be used as a light or weapon; the phone is to call for help; and the money is for car emergencies only (e.g., new windshield wipers or gas). Always keep your doors and windows locked and evaluate the effectiveness of the locks. Never open your door to a stranger and never tell them you are alone.</p>
                <p>2. Avoid unsafe situations and strangers. If you are being followed, go to the nearest police or fire department, or any place where several people will be (convenience stores, gas station, etc.) Walk in groups at night.</p>
                <p>3. Flee if you are in a potentially dangerous situation. Yell or scream to attract attention. Carry a whistle that will make a loud noise.</p>
                <p>4. Engage in passive or active resistance. Passive resistance is to think and talk your way out of a situation. Active resistance is to react immediately to startle your attacker. Use any available item (hairspray, keys, purse, etc.) as a weapon.</p>
                <p>5. Think! Keep using your mind to think of alternative actions for escape.</p>
                <p>6. You are responsible for your own safety. Call your local police department or rape crisis center and set up a schedule for a law enforcement officer to speak to your employees or neighbors.</p>
                <p>7. Don't let a stranger inside your home to use the phone; make the call for him.</p>
                <p>8. Never admit that you or a neighbor are home alone.</p>
                <p>9. Women living alone should use only initials on mailboxes and in telephone listings.</p>
                <p>10. Leave outside lights on at night, and keep lights on in more than 1 room.</p>
                <p>11. If you receive an obscene phone call just hang up and don't react.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p><b>Safety Tips While Walking:</b></p>
                <p>1. When possible, avoid walking alone. Walk with someone, or walk in areas where other people are near.</p>
                <p>2. Stay in well-lighted areas, away from alleys, bushes, and entryways.</p>
                <p>3. Avoid shortcuts through parks, vacant lots, and other deserted places.</p>
                <p>4. Don't hitchhike or accept rides from strangers.</p>
                <p>5. If a driver stops to ask you directions, avoid getting near the car.</p>
                <p>6. If you are being followed, go to the nearest business or residence for help.</p>
                <p>7. If you are harassed by the occupants of a car, simply turn and walk the other direction. The driver will have to turn around to follow you.</p>
                <p>8. Hold your purse close, not dangling, and avoid carrying extra money or valuables on your person.</p>
                <p>9. When you return home, have your door key ready so that you can enter without delay.</p>
                <p>10. Don't walk or jog at night wearing headphones. You need to be able to hear someone driving up or walking up behind you.</p>

                <p><b>Safety Tips for Youth:</b></p>
                <p>1. Children should be made aware of the dangers of accepting rides from or talking to strangers.</p>
                <p>2. Children should be encouraged to talk with their parents if they ever have a problem, not only with a stranger but also with a friend or relative.</p>
                <p>3. Children should know a safe, well-traveled route to take to and from school. Isolated areas should be avoided.</p>
                <p>4. Teenage baby-sitters should not accept jobs with people they do not know, or who have not been referred by people they know.</p>
                <p>5. Babysitters should call the police immediately if anything suspicious happens at the house. They should never open the door for strangers.</p>
                <p>6. The sitter's parents should be called at the end of the evening to inform them that the sitter will be home shortly.</p>
                <p>7. You may follow the advice and safety tips recommended and still find yourself confronted by an attacker. If it happens, you will have only seconds to decide your method of defense, so you must prepare mentally for the possibility of rape happening to you.</p>
